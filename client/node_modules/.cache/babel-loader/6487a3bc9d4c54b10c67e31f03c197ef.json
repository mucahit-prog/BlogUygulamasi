In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n\t *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n\t *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n\t *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\". Halves of \"surrogate pairs\" have a meaning only when placed next to each other.\n\t *  For example `𨭎` is represented in `String` by `\\uD862\\uDF4E`. Both `\\uD862` and `\\uDF4E` do not have any meaning\n\t *  outside the pair (are rendered as ? when alone). Position between them would be incorrect. In this case, selection\n\t *  extension will include whole \"surrogate pair\".\n\t *  * `'word'` - moves selection by a whole word.\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** if you extend a forward selection in a backward direction you will in fact shrink it.\n\t *\n\t * @fires modifySelection\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/selection~Selection|module:engine/model/documentselection~DocumentSelection} selection\n\t * The selection to modify.\n\t * @param {Object} [options]\n\t * @param {'forward'|'backward'} [options.direction='forward'] The direction in which the selection should be modified.\n\t * @param {'character'|'codePoint'|'word'} [options.unit='character'] The unit by which selection should be modified.\n\t */\n\tmodifySelection( selection, options ) {\n\t\tmodifySelection( this, selection, options );\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Gets a clone of the selected content.\n\t *\n\t * For example, for the following selection:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <paragraph>x</paragraph>\n\t * <blockQuote>\n\t *\t<paragraph>y</paragraph>\n\t *\t<heading1>fir[st</heading1>\n\t * </blockQuote>\n\t * <paragraph>se]cond</paragraph>\n\t * <paragraph>z</paragraph>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * It will return a document fragment with such a content:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <blockQuote>\n\t *\t<heading1>st</heading1>\n\t * </blockQuote>\n\t * <paragraph>se</paragraph>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * @fires getSelectedContent\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/selection~Selection|module:engine/model/documentselection~DocumentSelection} selection\n\t * The selection of which content will be returned.\n\t * @returns {module:engine/model/documentfragment~DocumentFragment}\n\t */\n\tgetSelectedContent( selection ) {\n\t\treturn getSelectedContent( this, selection );\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Checks whether the given {@link module:engine/model/range~Range range} or\n\t * {@link module:engine/model/element~Element element} has any meaningful content.\n\t *\n\t * Meaningful content is:\n\t *\n\t * * any text node (`options.ignoreWhitespaces` allows controlling whether this text node must also contain\n\t * any non-whitespace characters),\n\t * * or any {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#isObject object element},\n\t * * or any {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~Marker marker} which\n\t * {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~Marker#_affectsData affects data}.\n\t *\n\t * This means that a range containing an empty `<paragraph></paragraph>` is not considered to have a meaningful content.\n\t * However, a range containing an `<image></image>` (which would normally be marked in the schema as an object element)\n\t * is considered non-empty.\n\t *\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/range~Range|module:engine/model/element~Element} rangeOrElement Range or element to check.\n\t * @param {Object} [options]\n\t * @param {Boolean} [options.ignoreWhitespaces] Whether text node with whitespaces only should be considered empty.\n\t * @returns {Boolean}\n\t */\n\thasContent( rangeOrElement, options ) {\n\t\tconst range = rangeOrElement instanceof ModelElement ?
